Ross-Lloyd---Pick-and-Place-Writeup - Udacity RoboND

This is the repository for my writeup of the Pick and Place project with the Udacity Robotics Nanodegree.

The aim of the project was to use the correct mathematical analyses to find the forward and inverse kinematics, so that python code could be created that would ultimately follow a plan of "waypoints" generated by code provided to us.

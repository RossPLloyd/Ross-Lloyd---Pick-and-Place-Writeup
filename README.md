Udacity Robotics Nanodegree

Project: Pick and Place.

This is an implementation of The Amazon Challenge, where a robot must retrieve items from a shelf and place them in an appropriate 'bin'.

The writeup can be found via [this link](https://github.com/RossPLloyd/Ross-Lloyd---Pick-and-Place-Writeup/blob/master/Pick%20and%20Place%20writeup/AAMAIN/Ross%20Lloyd%20-%20Pick%20and%20Place%20Writeup.md)

The aim of the project was to use the correct mathematical analyses to find the forward and inverse kinematics, so that python code could be created that would ultimately follow a plan of "waypoints" generated by code provided to us.

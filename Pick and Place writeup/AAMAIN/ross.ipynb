    "*Fill in the IK_server.py file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles.*\n",

    "I found this project to be extremely challenging, and as a result the code for my completed project comes mainly from the provided walkthrough, with a few tweaks and changes. For an in-depth explanation of what each line is doing, please refer to the comments in the included IK_server script.\n",
    "\n",
    "I realised that not all DH Parameters and Homogenous Transformations are necessary in the calculations of Inverse Position and Orientation, and so in the interests of reducing cycle time I commented out those sections not required by the code. If I had chosen to implement the \"challenge\" elements of the project I would have needed to include especially the elements finding the forward kinematics to allow me to compare between the values found by the Inverse Kinematic calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also changed the method for finding the inverse of R0_3 in the line \"R3_6 = R0_3.T * ROT_EE\". The classroom recommended using the LU decomposition, however I found that this lead to inaccurate positioning of the robot manipulator. Given that the transpose of an orthogonal matrix is equal to its inverse, I used the .T transpose method. I believe this was more accurate as the LU decomposition carries out calculations of its own, and could have introduced errors which may have been compounded by subsequent calculations. Transpose on the other hand simply changes the arrangement of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also decided to use the function definition of the transformation matrices given in the walktrhough as this was cleaner and solve time was reduced. I have however included the original \"long form\" symbolic matrices in comments for illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy in my tests was extremely good with 98-100% success rate. The only occasional failure I saw occurred when a plan is generated that is extremely close to the shelf retrieving the sample from position 3. The end effector would \"try\" to precisely match the plan at an inopportune moment, leading to a rotation of the sample that can sometimes lead to it hitting the shelf as it turns. However this is very rare in my testing and the end effector is nonetheless sticking to the plan. One way to possibly prevent it may have been to grip the samnple in the middle rather than at the top.\n",
